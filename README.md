# ***Qdrant-Based Document Retrieval System Using LangChain**

## **📌 Overview**
This project demonstrates how to use **Qdrant** as a vector database for storing and retrieving document embeddings. The workflow includes:
- **Loading documents** from a PDF file.
- **Splitting the text** into manageable chunks.
- **Generating embeddings** using Hugging Face BGE (`BAAI/bge-large-en`).
- **Storing embeddings in Qdrant** for efficient vector-based search.
- **Retrieving relevant documents** based on user queries.

---

## **📂 Project Structure**
- **Ingestion Process**: Processes documents and stores them in Qdrant.
- **Query System**: Retrieves relevant documents based on user input.

---

## **🛠️ Setup Instructions**
### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**
Ensure Python (`>=3.8`) is installed, then install the required libraries, including LangChain, Qdrant, and Hugging Face embeddings.

---

### **2️⃣ Start Qdrant Server**
Qdrant needs to be running locally. If you don’t have it installed, it can be started using Docker.

---

## **📥 Step 1: Ingest Data**
This step involves:
- **Loading a PDF document**.
- **Splitting text into smaller chunks** for efficient retrieval.
- **Generating embeddings** using Hugging Face's BGE model.
- **Storing embeddings in Qdrant** for later retrieval.

Once the ingestion process is complete, the embeddings are indexed in Qdrant.

---

## **🔍 Step 2: Query the Database**
This step involves:
- **Connecting to Qdrant** to access the stored embeddings.
- **Performing a similarity search** to retrieve the most relevant documents.
- **Ranking results using similarity scores** to ensure accurate retrieval.

After executing the query, relevant document chunks are returned based on semantic similarity.

---

## **📌 Key Features**
- **Semantic Search with Qdrant**: Uses vector-based retrieval for improved accuracy.
- **Hugging Face BGE Embeddings**: Enhances search results with pre-trained language models.
- **Efficient Querying**: Retrieves top-matching documents with similarity scores.
- **Scalable & Fast**: Supports large-scale document retrieval.

---

## **📢 Future Enhancements**
- **BM25 Hybrid Search**: Combine vector search with traditional keyword search.
- **Reranking for Better Results**: Implement a reranking model like `BAAI/bge-reranker-large` to improve search accuracy.
- **Deploy as a REST API**: Convert the system into a web-based service for external usage.

---

## **🚀 Conclusion**
This project demonstrates a **Qdrant-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** using **LangChain and Hugging Face embeddings**. It enables **fast, accurate document search and retrieval** for various NLP applications.

This solution can be extended further for enterprise search, chatbot knowledge retrieval, or AI-powered document analysis.
